    <h1>Welcome to TeleNode, <?= $name ?>!</h1>
    <h3>TeleNode is an open-source and free interactive video platform.&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><br></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To be able to create a TeleNode project you will first need to have a YouTube account to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/upload" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upload</a> your videos to. You can sign up for an account <a href="https://www.youtube.com/upload" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> if you don&apos;t have one already.&nbsp;</li>
        <br>
        <li>TeleNode does not host any videos but rather grabs them directly from YouTube. This allows TeleNode to operate at a minimal cost and therefore allows it to be free and host an unlimited amount of interactive projects. However, this comes at the cost of having to follow YouTube&apos;s copyright rules and thus, copyrighted materials such as music and other copyrighted materials will not be allowed on the platform. *Do note that some videos are not supported in HD as well and will be defaulted to 480p resolution as a result. This will however be fixed in future versions of TeleNode</li>
        <br>
        <li>Alternatively, you could use videos that are already publicly available but be sure to follow copyright rules and do not use content that isn&apos;t free or not yours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once you have uploaded your videos onto YouTube, you can copy the video links and paste them in the <a href="create.php">create</a> page and follow the instructions to start a new TeleNode project.&nbsp;</li>
        <br>
        <li>After creating a project you may refer to the video tutorial below to start your first project</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How Does TeleNode&apos;s "Unique Blocks" Work?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>TeleNode uses a unique block naming system as a way to create and traverse your interactive projects</p>
    <br>
    <p>Every option provided will create a new block with 3 more possible options from there. Be sure to use unique names for each unique block. Using the same name will bring you back to the first instance of a block with that name.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example if you want to bring the user back to the start of the project you could have a block titled "Starting Block" and when clicked the user will be brought back to the first video in the project as all projects have a default first block named "Starting Block".
    </p>
